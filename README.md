# Super Mario Practical

Welcome to our Super Mario Game Development Project. This project aims to create a Super Mario-like game using the Unity engine and C# scripting. The project covers aspects such as 2D art and animations, level design, and audio design.

## Pre-production Phase

This phase includes defining the game's scope, the required assets, the game's functionalities, and the project's timeframe.

## Learning Phase

We will need to understand the basics of Unity and C# before we can start the development. Unity is the game engine we will be using and C# is the scripting language used to define game behavior.

## Development Phase

This is the core phase of our project where we will create our own game. It includes creating our assets (or sourcing them), implementing our functionality and testing our game.

## Polishing Phase

After our game is functionally complete, we will likely need to spend some time polishing it. This can include tweaking gameplay, fixing bugs, improving graphics and optimizing performance.

## Release Phase

Once we are happy with our game, it's time to release it. This could involve publishing it to a platform like the Unity Asset Store, Google Play, or Apple's App Store.

## Trello Board

We use a Trello board to manage the development process. Here are the list names and their respective card names:

## Additional Resources

Please note that this is a high-level overview. Each step would require a detailed understanding and learning depending on the complexity of the game. There are many online tutorials, documentation and courses available to help everyone with each step of the game development process. Game development can be a complex process but it is also a lot of fun and very rewarding. If we do have any materials which can be relative for the development of the game and can be used as a reference to build this game, it can be found under this section.
